This project investigates the short-term impact of temperature on all-cause mortality using the Distributed Lag Non-Linear Model (DLNM) framework. Based on real daily temperature data from India (2013–2018), we simulated daily death counts and modeled the delayed and non-linear relationship between temperature and mortality. The analysis identified a total of 10,720 deaths attributable to non-optimal temperatures over the six-year period, out of 268,537 total deaths, corresponding to an attributable fraction of 3.99%. Key outputs include exposure–lag–response contour plots, cumulative relative risk curves, and estimated daily attributable deaths. This project demonstrates the use of DLNM for quantifying temperature-related health risks in a climate-sensitive public health context.
